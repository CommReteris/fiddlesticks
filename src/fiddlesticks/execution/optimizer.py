OptimizedPipelineExecutor for Performance-Enhanced Pipeline Execution.

This module provides the OptimizedPipelineExecutor class that implements
performance optimizations for pipeline execution including:
- Batching optimization for consecutive single-image operations
- Memory management for memory-intensive multi-input operations
- Device assignment optimization for GPU/CPU operations
- Parallelization opportunities identification
- Execution plan analysis and optimization

Key Features:
- Automatic execution plan generation based on operation characteristics
- Batching groups for consecutive compatible operations
- Memory checkpoints for large tensor operations
- Device-aware execution planning
- Performance monitoring and profiling hooks
